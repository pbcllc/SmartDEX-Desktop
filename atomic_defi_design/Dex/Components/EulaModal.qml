<h3>Governing Law, Forum and Venue</h3>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, If you are a user located in the United States, the terms in the 'Special Arbitration Provision for United States' section below apply to you.</p>
<p>If you are not located in the United States, you agree that you will resolve any claim you have with us relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our Terms, us, or our Services (each, a 'Dispute,' and together, 'Disputes') exclusively in the state courts located in Delaware, or federal court for Delaware and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such Disputes.</p>
<h3>Special Arbitration Provision for United States Users</h3>
<p>If you are a user located in the United States, you and SmartFi agree that any Dispute <b>shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at <a href='https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules'>https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules</a>) and you and SmartFi hereby expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit, private attorney general actions, or class-wide arbitration,</b> except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an 'IP Protection Action'). The exclusive jurisdiction of an IP Protection Action shall be the courts of Delaware and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating IP Protection Actions.</p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any court of law. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this Special Arbitration Provision is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this Special Arbitration Provision shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this User Agreement, will continue to apply.</p>
<h2>General Terms</h2>
